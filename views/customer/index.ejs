            <b><i>Our quest to provide organic farm fresh products began with our
                search for sustainable farming practices and is backed by an
                unflinching focus on quality. Quality benchmarks for all process
                and practices on the farm and in the post-harvest facilities have
                been laid down and systems are in place to monitor the efficacy of
                the same. While all final organic farm fresh products are tested
                at International certified laboratories, our internal set up
                ensures continuous testing and evaluation. The journey commenced
                with grassroots level farming operations in inhospitable terrain,
                but the long-term vision encompasses farm to food or farm to table
                products being developed in-house for direct delivery to the
                consumer. With this in mind, we have now embarked on in-house
                product innovation and development too.</i></b>
